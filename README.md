# GitHub Clone

## Description
A GitHub-inspired web application built using the MERN stack. The platform replicates core functionalities of GitHub, enabling users to create and manage repositories, upload and download code files, and handle user authentication. Designed with modular architecture and a clean UI for seamless interaction.

## Tech Stack
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing user data and repository metadata.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **React.js**: Frontend library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: Server-side runtime environment.
- **Bootstrap**: UI styling framework for responsive design.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-clone.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd github
3.Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
    npm install
  ````
4. Create a .env file and add your MongoDB connection string and any other required environment variables.

5. Run the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node index.js start

6. Run the frontend:
  ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
```
7.You will get a link in terminal ctrl+click to open the frontend on browser.

## Features

- User Authentication & Authorization: Secure login and role-based access to repositories.

- Repository Creation: Users can create repositories directly from the frontend.

- Code Upload & Download: Upload multiple files to cloud storage and download them as needed.

- MVC Architecture: Structured codebase following the Model-View-Controller pattern for better maintainability.

## CLI Commands

This GitHub clone includes a custom CLI interface to handle file versioning and interaction with the cloud storage. Below are the available commands:

### Note: Make sure you are inside the backend directory before running any of these commands. To navigate to the backend directory, please refer to the 5th step of the Installation Instructions. Apologies for the inconvenience â€” we're working on streamlining this process soon!

## Add a file to the staging area
```bash
node index.js add <filePath>
```

## Commit the staged files with a message
```bash
node index.js commit "<message>"
```
## Push committed files to the cloud storage
```bash
node index.js push
```

## Pull all files from the cloud to your local machine
```bash
node index.js pull
```

## Set a remote origin for syncing with a cloud bucket
```bash
node index.js remote add origin <link>
```
